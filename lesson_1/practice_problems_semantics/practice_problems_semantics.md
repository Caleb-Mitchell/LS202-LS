1.
- semantic:
  - article
  - aside
  - footer
  - header
  - section
- not:
  <!-- - b -->
  - div
  <!-- - h3 -->
  - span
  <!-- - strong -->

  Answer: In HTML5, all content tags except <div> and <span> have semantic
  meaning. In particular, both <b> and <i> have semantic meaning.

2. Section, because it has content that makes sense to have a heading, and it
   does not necessarily make sense on its own.

   Answer: Actually <article> might make more sense, since the Gettyburg Address
   would make sense if we extracted it from here and put it elsewhere. It is
   self-contained and reusable.

3. <blockquote>, as the enclosed text is an extended quotation.

4. <section> as in this case it would not make sense on its own, and has a
   header.

5. <aside>, as this information reinforces the other text without being
   required.
